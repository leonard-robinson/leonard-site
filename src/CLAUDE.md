# Leonard Site - Project Context

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS (Feb 7, 2026)

**Site is 70% complete. CMS needs OAuth setup to work.**

- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub: `leonard-robinson/leonard-site`
- ✅ Deployed to Cloudflare Pages (live)
- ⚠️ **NEXT: OAuth setup** (5 min) → Then Leonard can publish
- ⚠️ **THEN: Custom domain** → Point leonardarobinson.com to site
- ⚠️ **OPTIONAL: Domain transfer** → Move from WordPress to Cloudflare

**📋 See detailed next steps:** `NEXT-STEPS.md` in project root

## Quick Reference

**What is this?**
Newspaper-themed portfolio site for Leonard A. Robinson (journalist) with blog publishing system.

**GitHub:** `leonard-robinson/leonard-site`
**Tech:** React + Vite + Decap CMS + Cloudflare Pages
**Blog:** `/blog` (works) | **CMS:** `/admin` (needs OAuth to work)

**Key files to reference:**
- `NEXT-STEPS.md` — What to do next (detailed steps)
- `CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT.md` — Full deployment guide
- `SETUP-CHECKLIST.md` — Checkbox-style checklist

## Proactive Reminders

**When user starts a new session:**
→ "Want to finish Leonard's site? Just need OAuth setup (5 min) and custom domain (5 min), then it's fully working."

**If user mentions Leonard's site:**
→ Reference `NEXT-STEPS.md` and current status above

**If 24+ hours pass:**
→ "Should we complete the OAuth setup for Leonard's CMS? Without it, he can't publish posts."

---

## Critical Context

1. **OAuth blocks everything** — `/admin` won't work until OAuth is configured
2. **Domain transfer is safe** — DNS/email copy automatically, zero downtime
3. **Leonard is non-technical** — He'll only use `/admin`, never see code
4. **Email forwarding is free** — Set up after domain transfers to Cloudflare

---

## What's Next

**Priority order:**
1. OAuth setup (makes `/admin` login work)
2. Custom domain (points leonardarobinson.com to site)
3. Test publishing (verify Leonard can write posts)
4. Domain transfer (optional, saves money)
