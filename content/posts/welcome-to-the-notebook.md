excerpt: Essays, reporting, and observations from the field.

This is where I'll be sharing longer pieces, reporting notes, and writing that doesn't fit the traditional assignment model. Consider it a working journal—less polished than published work, more honest than a pitch.

## What to expect

Stories that didn't make it into print. Observations from the beat. Experiments with form and voice. Things I'm thinking about but haven't fully figured out yet.

This is the space between the notebook and the newsroom. Not everything here will be perfect, but it'll be real.

More to come.
