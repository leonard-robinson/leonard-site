This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the publishing system. Leonard can edit or delete this once he's comfortable with the CMS.

## How to publish

1. Go to `/admin` on your site
2. Log in with GitHub
3. Click "New Post"
4. Write in the editor
5. Hit "Publish"

The post will automatically go live within 30 seconds.

## Markdown formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and other standard formatting. Add images, links, and blockquotes:

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." — Steve Jobs

Lists work too:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

That's it. Start writing.
